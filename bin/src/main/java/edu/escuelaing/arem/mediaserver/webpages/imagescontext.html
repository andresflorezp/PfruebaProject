        <p><b>Jean-Michel Basquiat:</b>
            <br>Jean-Michel Basquiat (December 22, 1960 – August 12, 1988) was an American artist of Haitian and
            <br>Puerto Rican descent. Basquiat first achieved fame as part of SAMO, an informal graffiti duo who
            <br>wrote enigmatic epigrams in the cultural hotbed of the Lower East Side of Manhattan during the
            <br>late 1970s where the hip hop, punk, and street art cultures had coalesced. By the 1980s, he was
            <br>exhibiting his neo-expressionist paintings in galleries and museums internationally. The Whitney
            <br>Museum of American Art held a retrospective of his art in 1992.</p>
